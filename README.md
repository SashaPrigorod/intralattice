## Overview

Intralattice is a collection of generative CAD components for [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/), used to generate solid lattice structures within a 3D design space. It was developed as an extensible, open-source alternative to current commercial solutions. As an ongoing project developed at McGillâ€™s Additive Design & Manufacturing Laboratory (ADML), it has been a valuable research tool, serving as a platform for breakthroughs in multi-scale design and optimization. By giving you full access to the source, we hope to collectively explore lattice design at a deeper level, and consequently, engineer better products.

## Core Components

The complete algorithm is divided into the following modules.

1. **CELL** - Defines a unit cell topology.
  * [PresetCell](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Cell/PresetCellComponent.cs) - Library of built-in unit cells
  * [CustomCell](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Cell/CustomCellComponent.cs) - Input for user-defined unit cell (includes validation)

2. **FRAME** - Generates a lattice frame by mapping the unit cell topology to a design space.
  * [BasicBox](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Frame/BasicBoxComponent.cs) - Simple box lattice
  * [BasicCylinder](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Frame/BasicCylinderComponent.cs) - Simple cylinder lattice
  * [ConformSS](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Frame/ConformSSComponent.cs) - Conforming Surface-to-Surface lattice
  * [ConformSA](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Frame/ConformSAComponent.cs) - Conforming Surface-to-Axis lattice
  * [ConformSP](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Frame/ConformSPComponent.cs) - Conforming Surface-to-Point lattice
  * [UniformDS](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Frame/UniformDSComponent.cs) - Trimmed Uniform Lattice (within Brep or Mesh)

3. **MESH** - Generates solid mesh of the lattice frame.
  * [Homogen](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Mesh/HomogenComponent.cs) - Homogeneous (constant strut radius)
  * [HeterogenGradient](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Mesh/HeterogenGradientComponent.cs) - Heterogeneous (gradient-based strut radius)
  * [HeterogenCustom](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Mesh/HeterogenCustomComponent.cs) - Heterogeneous (custom strut radius)

4. **UTILS** - Extra components for pre/post-processing.
  * [AdjustUV](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Utility/AdjustUVComponent.cs) - Flip/Reverse UV-map of surface
  * [MeshReport](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Utility/MeshReportComponent.cs) - Inspection of mesh
  * [MeshPreview](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Components/Utility/MeshReportComponent.cs) - Preview of mesh

## Core Data Layer
Many of the relevant algorithms are encapsulated in the following classes. Among others, the instance methods include lattice mapping, morphing, incremental 3D convex hull, sleeve meshing and trimming.

  * [UnitCell](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Data/UnitCell.cs) - Unit cell data object.
  * [Lattice](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Data/Lattice.cs) - Lattice wireframe data object, and its associated classes.
  * [ExoMesh](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Data/ExoMesh.cs) - Lattice mesh data object, and its associated classes.
  * [EndoMesh](./src/IntraLattice/CORE/Data/EndoMesh.cs) - Coming soon.

## Helper Layer
We also have a set of static methods.
